title: In between projects

At the moment I'm in between projects, I worked a lot on [koala](/laying-some-track). It has been five years since we started this project, and it was fun to do. Other members of the study association are continuing work on koala.

At the moment I'm planning a new project. A 16 by 16 led frame for animating images. I have my inspiration from the [Game Frame](https://ledseq.com/product/game-frame/), a project by Jeremy Williams. However his Game Frame is sold out. So I'm planning to create my own. I have bought a WS2812b led strip for my first build and a picture frame. I would like to use a PCB prototype manufacturer, perhaps even with SMT assembly.

Instead of using an Arduino, I will be using a Raspberry PI Zero W. A few plans using this additional computational power; using a web interface to add, order, and remove animations. The device should create a network if none is configured, after reboot the configured wifi is used. And finally, the web interface could get an editor to create animations painting any of the 256 boxes.
