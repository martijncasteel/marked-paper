description: For my blog I didn't want to use a CMS, so I wrote it using a markdown generator. My website is open-source, so you can check it out on github.

Testing writing of markdown! Automatic parsing of a new markdown file is now implemented, an awesome small feature soon to be available for everyone to use because I will open-source this website. The project can be found [here](https://github.com/martijncasteel/marked-paper). First, some styling issues have to be attended to.
