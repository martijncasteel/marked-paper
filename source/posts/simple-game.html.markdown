To try something I got the idea to create a small game. It's just for fun!

<canvas id="simple-game"><span id=""></span></canvas>
<script defer src="/javascripts/simple-game.js"></script>

The game should work with javascript and using an update/draw function to draw a new frame. 

```js
alert('input game code')
```
