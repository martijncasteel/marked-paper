    p Well about me, #[strong Martijn Casteel], at easy as that!

    p A lone writer, writing about some thrilling encounters mainly in IT. First exciting point to elaborate; Who am I? Quoted from a strange movie with Jackie Chan. Well I'm not that old (yet) and I do like programming.

    p I'm an IT guy, I've #[a(href='https://nl.linkedin.com/in/martijncasteel') studied] Computer Science and Technical Artificial Intelligence. The latter is kinda long and I have to explain it every time, so the short version is I'm building Jarvis and Sonny.
