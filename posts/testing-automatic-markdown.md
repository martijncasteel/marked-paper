Testing the writing of markdown! Automatic parsing of a new markdown file is now implemented, an awesome small feature soon to be available for everyone to use because I will open-source this website. The project can be found [here](https://github.com/martijncasteel/marked-paper). First some styling issues have to be attended to.
