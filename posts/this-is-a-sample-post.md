Writing this is kinda strange. I've started over for like 4 times, different tools, different languages but now I ended up with nodejs (I hope), never done this language before. But I wanted to start kinda blank for now, no bootstrap I don't require, no heavy admin panel, just a fun website (with a little bit of extra's here and there).
